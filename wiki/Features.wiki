#summary Present and future features of Carom

= Present Features =

  * Extremely fast, arbitrary-precision, machine-independent arithmetic, through use of the MPFR library
  * Template-based, compile-time unit-correctness checking
  * Three-dimensional physics

= Future Features =

Most of these features only need to be re-written from an earlier draft of parts of the code.

  * Rigid/soft-body dynamics
  * Mesh-based collision-detection
  * Multi-threaded RK4 support
