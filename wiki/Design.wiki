#summary An overview of the carom library

= Overview =

Carom itself takes the form of a C++ library, with a logical class hierarchy and extensible design. The highest-level class is called `[system]`, and it controls the RK4 integration. Systems themselves store a collection of bodies. The `body` class is used to store a collection of particles that must be integrated at the same time. `body` acts as a base class, and classes derrived from it specify how integration should be performed; for example, `rigid_body`s behave like rigid bodies when they are integrated.

The `particle` class stores mass, position, momentum, and force, as well as a list of forces applied to it. The [`applied_force` applied_force] class is a base class; custom forces derrive from this class, and override the virtual function [`force` applied_force] to specify the force applied.

[vector Vectors] and [scalar scalars] in the carom library are handled specially. They are unit-safe, meaning that the `scalar_mass` type is different from the `scalar_energy` type, and adding the two, or assigning one to the other, is an error at compile-time.
